# Board Setup

## Banker
Choose a banker(s) by whatever method you wish.

## Token Placement
There are **four (4)** different types of tokens that will be dropped or placed randomly (Players' choice) on the board for setup.

|Token|Symbol|Quantity|
|---|---|---|
|Item|🎁|5 x Player Count|
|Resource|💎|5 x Player Count|
|Monster|🧟|5 x Player Count|
|Mine|⚒️|4 x Player Count|

> *Example*
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> 
> |Token|Symbol|Quantity|
> |---|---|---|
> |Item|🎁|15|
> |Resource|💎|15|
> |Monster|🧟|15|
> |Mine|⚒️|12|

## City Placement
Once the **First Player** has been determined, the `City` of each Player will be placed on **any** open tile on the map.  The **First Player** will place his or her `City` first, the each Player *counter clockwise* will take turns placing his or her city until all `Cities` have been placed.
