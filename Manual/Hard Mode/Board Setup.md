## Token Placement
There are **four (4)** different types of tokens that will be dropped or placed randomly (Players' choice) on the board for setup.

|Token|Symbol|Quantity|
|---|---|---|
|Item|游꾸|5 x Player Count|
|Resource|游눑|5 x Player Count|
|Monster|游릎5 x Player Count|
|Mine|丘뉦잺|4 x Player Count|

> |Token|Symbol|Quantity|
> |---|---|---|
> |Item|游꾸|15|
> |Resource|游눑|15|

## City Placement
Once the **First Player** has been determined, the `City` of each Player will be placed on **any** open tile on the map.  The **First Player** will place his or her `City` first, the each Player *counter clockwise* will take turns placing his or her city until all `Cities` have been placed.
