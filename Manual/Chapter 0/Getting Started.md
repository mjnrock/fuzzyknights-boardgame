# Getting Started
## Distribute Resources
There are **four (4)** different types of resources

|Resource|Symbol|
|---|---|
|Coin|💰|
|Wood|🌳|
|Food|🥩|
|Stone|⛏️|

Each Player receives an **initial cache** of resources, as specified below.

|💰|🌳|
|---|---|
|**`+5`**|**`+10`**|

---

## Determine First Player
Every Player will roll **`1d6`**. The highest roll goes first and Player turn-order will proceed *counter clockwise* from the **First Player**.
In the event of ties on the highest rolls, those Players continue to roll **`1d6`** until the tie is resolved.

|Roll|
|---|
|🎲 **`1d6`**|

> *Example*
> **Comparing Rolls**
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> 
> |Player|Roll|Result|
> |---|---|---|
> |Player A|**`1d6`**|🎲 **6**|
> |Player B|**`1d6`**|🎲 **2**|
> |Player C|**`1d6`**|🎲 **3**|
> 
> As a result, **Player A** goes first.  Play would proceed *counter clockwise* to **Player A**

---

## Play Phases
Turns are broken down into **two (2)** cycles: **1) Acquisition** and **2) Exploration**. Before **all** Player turns, a new Day arises resulting in resource gains and the ability to strengthen fortifications and military size.

Once all Players have gone through the phases below:

*`Acquisition`*
During this cycle, **all** Players perform actions simultaneously in real-time, within whatever phase they are currently in.
1. **Resource Phase**
2. **Remittance Phase**
3. **Build & Recruitment Phase**
   
*`Exploration`*
During this cycle, the **First Player** performs his or her `Exploration Phase`, and upon completion, it moves to the next Player in sequence.
1. **Exploration Phase**

then the `Acquisition` cycle is over and `Exploration Phases` begin for the Players, starting with the **First Player** and moving *counter clockwise* through the Players.

## Player Turns
### Exploration Phase
#### Movement [ 🐎 ]
To begin exploring, roll **`1d10`** to determine movement range for **each Hero**.  Each result number amounts to one tile of movement.  The Player can **`MOVE`** his or her Heroes (up to each individual roll limit for the turn) in any interval, in any rotation or order, until all movement is either exhausted or all Heroes have chosen to **`STAY`**.

> *Example*
> **Rolling for Movement**
> 
> **Total Heroes: 3**
> 
> |Hero|Roll|Result|
> |---|---|---|
> |Hero A|**`1d10`**|🎲 **4**|
> |Hero B|**`1d10`**|🎲 **9**|
> |Hero C|**`1d10`**|🎲 **1**|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Hero A: 🐎(+4) this turn`**

> **`Hero B: 🐎(+9) this turn`**
> 
> **`Hero C: 🐎(+1) this turn`**

> 
> *Example*
> **Movement Sequence**
> 
> |Sequence|Action|🐎 A|🐎 B|🐎 C|
> |---|---|---|---|---|

## Resources

|Roll|
|---|
|🎲 **`1d4`**|

|Result|Resource|
|---|---|
|🎲 **1**|💰|
|🎲 **2**|🌳|
|🎲 **3**|🥩|
|🎲 **4**|⛏️|

### Mines [ ⚒️ ]
Upon landing on a tile with a `Mine` token, the Player can attempt to `CAPTURE` the `Mine`.  Upon a `CAPTURE`, immediately collect **`+1`** of the `Resource` of the `Mine`.  To determine the `Resource` of the `Mine`, roll a **`1d4`** to determine the type of the `Mine`, if it has not yet been determined.

The Player must roll **`1d20`** to determine if the `Mine` has any Guardians present.  If the `Mine` interaction results in a `CAPTURE`, it becomes owned by the conquering Player.

> *Example*
> 
> **Rolling for Mine Guardians**
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`1d20`**|🎲 **4**|
> 
> **Rolling for Resource Type on Undetermined Mine**
> 
> |Roll|Result|Resource|
> |---|---|---|
> |**`1d4`**|🎲 **3**|**🥩**|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: Successfully CAPTURE Mine`**
> 
> **`Player: 🥩(+1)`**

#### Guardians

If the Player rolls an **`18`**, **`19`**, or **`20`** then the `Mine` **has** Guardians.  The Player then rolls a **`1d6 +2`** to determine how many `Creatures` are guarding the `Mine`.

> *Example*
> **Rolling for Mine Guardians**
>
> |Roll|Result||Guardian|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |**`1d20`**|🎲 **19**|=|🧟️ x **`1d6 +2`**|
> 
> Guardian Quantity Roll
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`1d6 +2`**|🎲 **4**|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: Must FIGHT 🧟️(4).`**

##### Hero Loss / Death
If the interacting Hero loses all of his or her `Troops` as a result of the Guardian battle, then that Hero is immediately removed from play.  Any `Items` on the Hero are dropped on the `Mine` tile.  Those `Items` can then be acquired by any Hero that collects them.

### Cities [ 🏰 ]
Upon landing on a tile with a foreign `City` token (Player-Owned or Neutral), the assaulting Player gains the opportunity to siege the `City` in an attempt to control it and gain access to its `Resource` generation and buildings.

#### Player-Owned


#### Neutral
If a Neutral `City` is assaulted, the Player must roll to determine the size of the Defending army.
