# Getting Started
Unless specifically specified, the core set of rules pertains to **all game modes**.  By default, `Normal Mode` is used with explicit exceptions written for `Campaign Mode`.

**`[ ☠️ CAMPAIGN MODE ☠️ ]`**

There is a more complex rule set that can be used instead when playing the game in `Campaign Mode`.  While the normal game is aimed a shorter length version, the `Campaign Mode` is designed to be able to sustain an extremely long adventure with potentially tens of hours of play for one game.

Please consult the "Campaign Mode" rules addendum for specific details.

## Distribute Resources
There are **four (4)** different types of resources

|Resource|Symbol|
|---|---|
|Coin|💰|
|Wood|🌳|
|Food|🥩|
|Stone|⛏️|

Each Player receives an **initial cache** of resources, as specified below.

|💰|🌳|
|---|---|
|**`+5`**|**`+10`**|

---

## Determine First Player
Every Player will roll **`1d6`**. The highest roll goes first and Player turn-order will proceed *counter clockwise* from the **First Player**.
In the event of ties on the highest rolls, those Players continue to roll **`1d6`** until the tie is resolved.

|Roll|
|---|
|🎲 **`1d6`**|

> *Example*
> **Comparing Rolls**
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> 
> |Player|Roll|Result|
> |---|---|---|
> |Player A|**`1d6`**|🎲 **6**|
> |Player B|**`1d6`**|🎲 **2**|
> |Player C|**`1d6`**|🎲 **3**|
> 
> As a result, **Player A** goes first.  Play would proceed *counter clockwise* to **Player A**

---

## Play Phases
Turns are broken down into **two (2)** cycles: **1) Acquisition** and **2) Exploration**. Before **all** Player turns, a new Day arises resulting in resource gains and the ability to strengthen fortifications and military size.

**Acquisition Cycle**

During this cycle, **all** Players perform actions simultaneously in real-time, within whatever phase they are currently in.
1. **Resource Phase**
2. **Remittance Phase**
3. **Build & Recruitment Phase**
   
**Exploration Cycle**

During this cycle, the **First Player** performs his or her `Exploration Phase`, and upon completion, it moves to the next Player in sequence.
1. **Exploration Phase**

Once all Players have gone through the phases above then the `Acquisition` cycle is over and `Exploration Phases` begin for the Players, starting with the **First Player** and moving *counter clockwise* through the Players.

## Player Turns
### Exploration Phase
#### Movement [ 🐎 ]
To begin exploring, roll **`1d10`** to determine movement range for **each Hero**.  Each result number amounts to one tile of movement.  The Player can **`MOVE`** his or her Heroes (up to each individual roll limit for the turn) in any interval, in any rotation or order, until all movement is either exhausted or all Heroes have chosen to **`STAY`**.

> *Example*
> **Rolling for Movement**
> 
> **Total Heroes: 3**
> 
> |Hero|Roll|Result|
> |---|---|---|
> |Hero A|**`1d10`**|🎲 **4**|
> |Hero B|**`1d10`**|🎲 **9**|
> |Hero C|**`1d10`**|🎲 **1**|
> 
> The rolls are **not** reassignable (e.g. the 🎲 **1** roll *cannot* be given to Hero A, instead)
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Hero A: 🐎(+4) this turn`**
> 
> **`Hero B: 🐎(+9) this turn`**
> 
> **`Hero C: 🐎(+1) this turn`**

> 
> *Example*
> **Movement Sequence**
> 
> |Sequence|Action|🐎 A|🐎 B|🐎 C|
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> |**Hero A**|**`MOVE 🐎(-1)`**|`4 - 1 = 3`|`9`|`1`|
> |**Hero C**|**`STAY 🐎`**|`3`|`9`|`STAY => 0`|
> |**Hero B**|**`MOVE 🐎(-7)`**|`3`|`9 - 7 = 2`|`0`|
> |**Hero A**|**`MOVE 🐎(-3)`**|`3 - 3 = 0`|`2`|`0`|
> |**Hero B**|**`MOVE 🐎(-2)`**|`0`|`2 - 2 = 0`|`0`|
> |Player|*End of Turn*|**0**|**0**|**0**|
> 
> The example immediatebly above is here to emphasize that you as the Player are **not** restricted to moving **one (1)** Hero at a time, but that you instead can move each Hero *up to* the amount of movement that each Hero individually rolled in any order you wish, maxing out at that Hero's movement roll that turn.  While this *can* add complexity by breaking up movement this way, you as the Player are fully allowed to go Hero by Hero to move, instead, if you want.

## Resources

**Determine Resource Type**

|Roll|🎲 1|🎲 2|🎲 3|🎲 4|

### Mines [ ⚒️ ]

**Determine Resource Type**

|Roll|🎲 1|🎲 2|🎲 3|🎲 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|🎲 **`1d4`**|💰|🌳|🥩|⛏️|

**Check for Guardians**

|Roll|🎲 10 - 80|🎲 90 - 100|

|🎲 **`1dP`**|`CAPTURE` `Mine`|`FIGHT` **`1d6 +2`** Monsters|

**Determine Guardian Quantity**

|Roll|
|---|
|🎲 **`1d6 +2`**|

Upon landing on a tile with a `Mine` token, the Player can attempt to `CAPTURE` the `Mine`.  Upon a `CAPTURE`, immediately collect **`+1`** of the `Resource` of the `Mine`.  To determine the `Resource` of the `Mine`, roll a **`1d4`** to determine the type of the `Mine`, if it has not yet been determined.

The Player must roll **`1d20`** to determine if the `Mine` has any Guardians present.  If the `Mine` interaction results in a `CAPTURE`, it becomes owned by the conquering Player.

> *Example*
> 
> **Rolling for Mine Guardians**
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`1d20`**|🎲 **4**|
> 
> **Rolling for Resource Type on Undetermined Mine**

> |---|---|---|
> |**`1d4`**|🎲 **3**|**🥩**|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: Successfully CAPTURE Mine`**
> 
> **`Player: 🥩(+1)`**

#### Guardians

If the Player rolls an **`18`**, **`19`**, or **`20`** then the `Mine` **has** Guardians.  The Player then rolls a **`1d6 +2`** to determine how many `Creatures` are guarding the `Mine`.

> *Example*
> **Rolling for Mine Guardians**
>
> |Roll|Result||Guardian|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |**`1d20`**|🎲 **19**|=|🧟️ x **`1d6 +2`**|
> 
> Guardian Quantity Roll
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`1d6 +2`**|🎲 **2 +2 = 4**|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: Must FIGHT 🧟️(4).`**

##### Hero Loss / Death
If the interacting Hero loses all of his or her `Troops` as a result of the Guardian battle, then that Hero is immediately removed from play.  Any `Items` on the Hero are dropped on the `Mine` tile.  Those `Items` can then be acquired by any Hero that collects them.

## Cities [ 🏰 ]
Upon landing on a tile with a foreign `City` token (Player-Owned or Neutral), the assaulting Player gains the opportunity to siege the `City` in an attempt to control it and gain access to its `Resource` generation and buildings.

### Player-Owned


### Neutral
If a Neutral `City` is assaulted, the Player must roll to determine the size of the Defending `Army`.

### Building


### Recruits
There are **five (5)** recruit slots in a city that can be populated and garrisoned in the `City` for strategic purposes.

Players can combine and/or split any identical Tier (1/2/3/4/5) and Rank (⭐/⭐⭐) creatures from his or her Heroes and/or Cities, while that Hero is currently garrisoned at a City.  Differently-Ranked creatured (even of the same Tier) cannot be combined until **all** of the garrisoned lower Rank (⭐) are promoted [Rank (⭐⭐)].

## Collectables
Upon moving to a tile with an `Item` or `Resource`, the Hero/Player respectively can acquire the collectable.

### Items
Draw an `Item` card from the deck.  Once an `Item` is drawn, attempt a `Quality Roll` by performing an opportunistic "promotion" to the `Item` rank, described below.

#### Quality Roll


### Resources
The Player must roll to determine the `Resource Type` and the quantity collected.  Upon collection, remove the `Resource` token from the board.

#### Type
Determine the `Resource Type` by rolling a **`1d4`**.

**Determine Resource Type**

|Roll|🎲 1|🎲 2|🎲 3|🎲 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|🎲 **`1d4`**|💰|🌳|🥩|⛏️|

#### Quantity
Determine the quantity collected by rolling a **`1d6`**.

|Roll|
|---|
|🎲 **`1d6`**|

> *Example*
> **Rolling for Resource Collection**

> |---|---|---|
> |**`1d6 +2`**|🎲 **5 +2 = 7**|**`🌳(+7)`**|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: 🌳(+7)`**

## Board Monsters
Upon a Hero landing on a Tile that has a Monster token, first roll a `1dP` to determine how to proceed.  Next, consult the interaction chart below.  If a battle results and the Player wins, the Player is rewarded **one (1)** per Neutral Monster killed. **`[ 💰(+1) x Neutral Monsters Killed = Total Reward 💰(+X)]`**  Reward gold is only given after a successful battle (i.e. not in cases of `BRIBE` or `DEFECT`).
**Roll for Interaction**

|Roll|🎲 10|🎲 20 - 70|🎲 80 - 90|🎲 100|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|🎲 **`1dP`**|`FIGHT` **`4d6`** Monsters|`FIGHT` **`2d6`** Monsters|`BRIBE` **`2d6`** Monsters|`DEFECT` **`2d6`** Monsters|

The Tier-rank for any Monsters resulting from `Mine` interactions (e.g. Guardians) or any Monster resultings from Monster-token interactions is determined by the highest-tiered Spawner that *any* Player has, **up to a max of Tier 3**.

> *Example*
> 
> **Determining Monster Tier**
>
> |Player|City 1 Highest-Tiered Spawner|City 2 Highest-Tiered Spawner|etc.|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |`Player A`|**`3`**|**`2`**|...|
> |`Player B`|**`4`**|`N/A`|...|
> |`Player C`|**`2`**|`N/A`|...|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: Interact with Tier 3 Monsters`**
> 
> Even though `Player B` has a **Tier 4** Spawner, Board Monsters cannot exceed **Tier 3**, so any Monsters from this nteraction will be **Tier 3**.

### Interactions
All interactions must determine which Tier of Monsters the Player will be attacking.  If the interaction results in the Player surviving, remove the Monster token from the board.
* Fight
  * Encampment
    * [ **`1dP`** = 🎲 10 ]
    * [ **`4d6`** Quantity]
  * Group
    * [ **`1dP`** = 🎲 20 - 70 ]
    * [ **`2d6`** Quantity]
* Bribe
  * [ **`1dP`** = 🎲 80 - 90 ]
  * [ **`2d6`** Quantity]
* Defect
  * [ **`1dP`** = 🎲 100 ]
  * [ **`2d6`** Quantity]

Any Monsters that cannot be `BRIBED` (e.g. due to lack of resources) or are refused during a `DEFECT` (e.g. the Player doesn't want them for whatever reason) are forfeited and the Monster token is removed from the board.  To summarize, if a `2d6` rolls `🎲 9` and the Player can only purchase **three (3)** Monsters, then s/he can purchase only up to **three (3)** and the remaining are lost forever.

> **NOTE:** All interaction examples below will assume **Tier 3** Monsters for the sake of consistency

### `FIGHT`
Monsters will **always** split into **two (2)** `Squads`, split as evenly as the Monster quantity will allow.

#### Encampment
Upon rolling a `🎲 10`, the attacking Player must `FIGHT` `4d6` Monsters.  

> *Example*
> This example will assume **Tier 3** Monsters
> 
> **Fighting an Encampment**> 
>
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`4d6`**|🎲 20|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: FIGHT twenty (20) Tier-3 Monsters split into two (2) Squads of ten (10) Monsters each`**

#### Group
Upon rolling a `🎲 20 - 70`, the attacking Player must `FIGHT` `2d6` Monsters. 

> *Example*
> This example will assume **Tier 3** Monsters
> 
> **Fighting a Group of Monsters**
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`2d6`**|🎲 7|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: FIGHT seven (7) Tier-3 Monsters split into two (2) Squads of four (4) and three (3) Monsters each`**

### `BRIBE`
Upon rolling a `🎲 80 - 90`, the attacking Player can opt to `BRIBE` up to `2d6` Monsters.  If the Player chooses to `BRIBE`, s/he must pay the same amount of resources as that Monster would cause if being recruited in a `City`.

> *Example*
> This example will assume **Tier 3** Monsters
> 
> **Bribing Monsters**
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`2d6`**|🎲 9|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: Can RECRUIT up to nine (9) Tier-3 Monsters at 💰(-3) each`**
> 
> **`e.g. 💰(-27) Total if all are purchased`**

### `DEFECT`
Upon rolling a `🎲 100`, the attacking Player can opt to `RECEIVE` up to `2d6` Monsters.

> *Example*
> This example will assume **Tier 3** Monsters
> 
> **Defection of Monsters**
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |---|---|
> |**`2d6`**|🎲 5|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Player: Can RECEIVE up to five (5) Tier-3 Monsters for free`**

## Battle
When attacking, a Player has the option to split his or her `Army` into (up to) **four (4) squads**, comprised of whatever combination of `Units` the Player desires, so long as there is at least **one (1)** in each squad.

A Player is not required to split into squads, it just simply allows for the Player to "play the odds" differently when rolling dice.

> *Example*
> **Breaking into Two (2) Squads**
> 
> An example `Army` composition of a Player
>
> |🧟️ Tier|Quantity|
> |---|---|
> |1|`15`|
> |2|`5`|
> |3️|`2`|
>
> An example `Squad` composition of that same Player
> |Squad|Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |A|`10`|`3`|-|
> |B|`5`|`2`|`2`|
> 
> **This example setup will be used to describe rolls**

To attack, a Players must decide to either use **Representative Rolls** or **Individual Rolls** to attack and defend.  Neutral camps **always** use **Representative Rolls**.

**Tier/Rank Dice**

||Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|Tier 5|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Rank 1**|`1d6`|`2d6`|`3d6`|`4d6`|`5d6`|
|**Rank 2**|`1d6 +3`|`2d6 +6`|`3d6 +9`|`4d6 +12`|`5d6 +15`|

Once the `Squads` have been segmented, decide which roll paradigm you wish to use and begin attacking the opponent's `Squads` in a manner similar to a turn-based RPG.  That is, if your team has `Squads A1 & B1` and the opponent has only `Squad A2`, the attacker at any turn can choose which of his or her squads will attack whichever `Squads` of the opponent that s/he chooses.

To perform battle, for each `Squad` choose an enemy `Squad` to attack, roll dice appropriate to either a **Representative Roll** or **Individual Roll** setup, have the opponent do the same, and then compare the **Totals** for each of the **two (2)** `Squads`.  Whichever `Squad` has the higher total wins the skirmish, and the **entire** `Squad` of the losing side is killed.  Battle continues until an one side's `Army` is completely killed, or the Player retreats.

#### Retreat
A **`RETREAT`** triggers an automatic forfeiture of that Hero and its accompanying `Army`.  Any items on that Hero are placed on the Tile, which can then potentially be recollected by another Hero upon venturing to that Tile.  If that Tile is occupied by a Token (e.g. Monster, City, Hero, etc.) that can perform battle, then the "defending" entity must be beat in battle before claiming the items again.

> *Example*
> 
> If a Hero retreats from fighting a monster group on the map *and* that Hero has items in its inventory, then the Hero is removed from player, its `Army` is disbanded, and the items are placed on the *same Tile* as the monster.  That monster must be defeated before another Hero can claim those items.

### Representative Rolls
In this mode, only **one (1)** version of the appropriate dice and *multiply* the result by the quantity of `Units` in that `Squad`.

> *Example*
> **Representative Rolls**
> 
> |Squad|Tier 1|Tier 3|Tier 2|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |A|`10`|`3`|`0`|
> |B|`5`|`2`|`2`|
> 
> |Squad|Tier 1 Roll|Tier 3 Roll|Tier 2 Roll|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |A|`10 * 1d6`|`3 * 2d6`|-|
> |B|`5 * 1d6`|`2 * 2d6`|`2 * 3d6`|
> 
> |Squad|Tier 1 Roll|Tier 3 Roll|Tier 2 Roll|Total|
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> |A|**`10` * 🎲 3 = 30**|**`3` * 🎲 7 = 21**|-|**30 + 21 = `🎲 51`**|
> |B|**`5` * 🎲 2 = 10**|**`2` * 🎲 9 = 18**|**`2` * 🎲 11 = 22**|**10 + 18 + 22 = `🎲 50`**|
> 

### Individual Rolls
In this mode, roll the appropriate dice for each `Unit` in that `Squad`.  Instead of rolling "one version" of the dice and multiplying by quantity, roll for every unit individually.

> *Example*
> **Individual Rolls**
> 
> |Squad|Tier 1 Roll|Tier 3 Roll|Tier 2 Roll|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |A|`1d6`, ..., `1d6` (10x🎲)|`2d6`, `2d6`, `2d6` (3x🎲)|-|
> |B|`1d6`, ..., `1d6` (5x🎲)|`2d6`, `2d6` (2x🎲)|`3d6`, `3d6` (2x🎲)|
> 
> |Squad|Tier 1 Roll|Tier 3 Roll|Tier 2 Roll|Total|
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> |A|**🎲 3 + ... + 🎲 4 = 41**|**🎲 7 + 🎲 8 + 🎲 12 = 27**|-|**41 + 27 = `🎲 68`**|
> |B|**🎲 1 + ... + 🎲 6 = 19**|**🎲 9 + 🎲 9 = 18**|**🎲 18 + 🎲 15 = 33**|**19 + 18 + 33 = `🎲 70`**|
