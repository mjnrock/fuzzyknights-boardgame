# Campaign Mode
`Campaign Mode` is designed as an "overlay", so-to-speak to the original rule set, expanding depth and expounding upon more RPG-like elements in the game.  **DO NOT USE** this guide if a shorter *(~60 min)*, simplified version of the game is desired.

> *At an inspirational level, this mode was designed to allow players to run a campaign (theoretically over multiple sessions), akin to a group of players running through a Dungeons and DragonsÂ® campaign.  As such, it is strictly intended for a single game to last many, many hours (>20 hrs).*

To facilitate adventuring campaigns, `Campaign Mode` allows for a much more in-depth version of the game.  Players should always use the `Core Ruleset` for any rules not explicated in this addendum.  In practice, use the `Campaign Mode` first (if present), and default to `Normal Mode` rules otherwise (if no explicit rule is present within this guide).
