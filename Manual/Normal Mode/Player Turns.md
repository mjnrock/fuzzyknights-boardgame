# Player Turns
After `☀️ Daybreak`, each Player takes his or her turn in a *counter clockwise* sequence, starting with the `Anchor`, as determined in the **Board Setup**.

## Hero [ 🧙‍ - `🎲 2d6 +6` ]
In `Battle`, the `🧙‍ Hero` is a unit itself with a roll of `🎲 2d6 +6`.  If the `🧙‍ Hero` falls in `Battle` (this is called `FAINTING`), its `Army` can still fight and if successful, the `🧙‍ Hero` will not die.

## Hero Movement [ 🐎 ]
Each `🧙‍ Hero` is able to `MOVE` up to `🎲 1d12 +12` Tiles.  A `🧙‍ Hero` may **only** expend movement from its own movement roll, and can voluntarily end its own movement for that turn at any point.

> **ELI5**
> 
> - *A `🧙‍ Hero` can't "gift" another `🧙‍ Hero` movement*
> - *A `🧙‍ Hero` does not have to use all of its movement*

A `🧙‍ Hero` may move on any **unoccupied** Tile for `🐎(-1)`.

If a Tile has multiple Tokens on it, then the Player must interact with ***each*** Token at an *additional* expense of `🐎(-1)` according to *Token Priority* (cf. **"Multiply-Occupied Tiles"**).

If the Player or `Ally` owns a `🏰 Settlement` or `⚒️ Mine`, then **all** `Alliance Heroes` can treat that Tile *as if* it were unoccupied.

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *`🧟 Monster`, `⚒️️ Mines`, and `🏰 Settlements` "occupy" an entire Tile and as such, only cost `🐎(-1)` total (i.e. Max `🐎(-1)` per Tile)*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *`🎁 Items` and `💰 Resources` cost ***an additional*** `🐎(-1)` per Token on that Tile (i.e. Max `🐎(-1) + 🐎(-1 * Token Count)` per Tile)*
---

## Hero Death
In **any and all** cases where a `🧙‍ Hero` dies, **all** `🎁 Items` on that `🧙‍ Hero` are dropped at the Tile on which the `🧙‍ Hero` died.

> **[ Special Case ]** If the `🧙‍ Hero` dies at a `🏰 Settlement`, the `🎁 Items` are instead placed within the `Armory` of that `🏰 Settlement` and normal `Armory` rules apply.

If the `🧙‍ Hero` had any `Mercenaries [ 🤺 ]` still alive within its command at the time of death (for any reason), then `1` `🧟 Monster` Token is placed on the Tile, as well.

> **TIP:** Strategically retreating from a fight with a "Pawn Hero" can force your enemy to deal with a `🧟 Monster` Token on his or her `🏰 Settlement`.  Be careful, though, as a Player is rewarded for killing `🧟 Monsters` and also has a `🎲 1dP` roll chance to acquire those `🧟 Monsters`.

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *A `🧙‍ Hero` death at a `🏰 Settlement` causes the `🎁 Items` **not to be** rerolled, as the cards instead transfer from the `🧙‍ Hero` directly to the `Armory` of the `🏰 Settlement`.*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *In the case of a `🧙‍ Hero` death on the same Tile as a `🏰 Settlement`, those `🧟 Monster` Tokens are placed on the **same Tile** as a `🏰 Settlement`.  Functionally, this means that the `🧟 Monster` Token must be defeated before access to/from the `🏰 Settlement` is possible (for any `🧙‍ Hero`--`Allied` or `Enemy`).  This `🧟 Monster` Token is treated like any other `🧟 Monster` Token and all normal `🧟 Monster` Token rules apply.*
---

## Mines [ ⚒️ ]
Upon landing on a tile with a `⚒️ Mine` Token, the Player can attempt to capture the `⚒️ Mine`.  Upon a successful capture, immediately collect **`💰(+1)`**.  Any time a Player attempts to change possession of a `⚒️ Mine`, roll a `🎲 1dP` to determine if the `⚒️ Mine` is guarded by `Guardians`.

If the `🎲 1dP` roll results in `Guardians`, the Player must roll (based on the table below) to determine how many `Guardians` will attempt to defend the `⚒️ Mine`.  If the Player then defeats the `Guardians`, s/he captures the `⚒️ Mine`.

If the `⚒️ Mine` was owned by a Player, then no ***bonus*** `💰 Resource` is collected for `Guardian` kills, ***only*** a capture and `💰(+1)` for the capture.

**Check for Guardians**

|Roll|🎲[10 - 80]|🎲[90 - 100]|
|---|---|---|
|🎲 `1dP`|`CAPTURE`|`FIGHT 🧟 Monsters`|

**Determine Guardian Quantity**

|Highest Overall|Roll|
|---|---|
|*Encampment*|🎲 `1d6`|
|*Villa*|🎲 `1d6 +2`|
|*Estate*|🎲 `2d6 +3`|
|*Castle*|🎲 `3d6 +4`|

**A `⚒️ Mine's` `🧟 Monster` quantity is determined by whatever Player has the ***highest*** `🏰 Settlement` rank**

> *Example*
> 
> **ASSUME:** That the *highest* `🏰 Settlement` construction is a `Villa` out of all Players `🏰 Settlements`.
>
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |🎲 `1dP`|`🎲[90]`|=>|`🎲 1d6 +2 Guardians`|
> 
> |Highest Overall|Roll|
> |---|---|
> |*Villa*|🎲 `1d6 +2`|
>
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |🎲 `1d6 +2`|`🎲[3] +2`|=>|`5 Guardians`|
> 
> **Player will `FIGHT 5 Guardians`**

## Resources [ 💰 ]
Upon landing on a Tile with a `💰 Resource` Token, roll a `🎲 1dP` to determine the cache size.  The cache size will determine how much `💰 Resource` the Player finds.

**Determine Cache Size**

|Roll|🎲[10 - 70]|🎲[80 - 100]|
|---|---|---|
|🎲 `1dP`|Small|Large|

**Determine Cache Reward**

|Cache Size|Reward Size Roll|
|---|---|
|Small|🎲 `1d6`|
|Large|🎲 `2d6`|

> *Example*
> 
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |🎲 `1dP`|`🎲[80]`|=>|`Large Cache`|
> 
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |🎲 `2d6`|`🎲[9]`|=>|`💰(+9)`|
> 
> **Player receives `💰(+9)`**

## Items [ 🎁 ]
All Players must agree on a ruleset below, though the Players are allowed to change the ruleset at any point, if it passes a `Vote`.

### Ruleset 1) Card & Dice Rules (Default Ruleset)
Upon landing on a Tile with an `🎁 Item` Token, draw a card from the `Item Deck`.  Roll the dice stated on the card to determine the `Rarity` of the `🎁 Item`.  Place a marker on the `Rarity` placeholder on the card's edge.

### Ruleset 2) Dice-Only Rules (Alternative Ruleset)
In lieu of cards, you may instead roll a `🎲 1dP` to determine the `Item Type` according to table below.  After determining `Item Type`, roll a `🎲 1dP` to determine `Rarity`.  Upon a **Success**, you may roll again; upon a **Failure** *do not* continue to roll.  **Always** start at `Common` and attempt upgrades from there.

**Determine Item Type**

|Roll|🎲[10 - 40]|🎲[50 - 80]|🎲[90 - 100]|
|---|---|---|---|
|🎲 `1dP`|`Main Hand`|`Off Hand`|`Amulet`|

**Determine Item Rarity**

|Roll|🎲[10 - 70]|🎲[80 - 100]|
|---|---|---|
|🎲 `1dP`|**Failure**|**Success**|

If a Player rolls a **Success**, add `+1 Rarity Level` to the `🎁 Item`, else remain at current `Rarity Level`.

> *Example* Immediate Failure
> 
> A **Failure** on the **first (1st)** roll results in `Common Rarity`.

> *Example* Immediate Success
> 
> A **Success** on the **first (1st)** roll results in `Uncommon Rarity`, ***roll again***
> 
> A **Success** on the **second (2nd)** roll results in `Rare Rarity`, ***roll again***
> 
> A **Failure** on the **third (3rd)** roll remains in `Rare Rarity`.
 
The `Item's` final stats are determined by the `Rarity` chart below:

***Main Hand***

|Rarity Level|Name|Roll|
|-|-|-|
|1|`Common`|`🎲 1d6`|
|2|`Uncommon`|`🎲 1d6 +1`|
|3|`Rare`|`🎲 2d6`|
|4|`Epic`|`🎲 2d6 +3`|
|5|`Legendary`|`🎲 3d6 +5`|

***Off Hand***

|Rarity Level|Name|Roll|
|-|-|-|
|1|`Common`|`🎲 1d6`|
|2|`Uncommon`|`🎲 1d6 +1`|
|3|`Rare`|`🎲 2d6`|
|4|`Epic`|`🎲 2d6 +3`|
|5|`Legendary`|`🎲 3d6 +5`|

***Amulet***

|Rarity Level|Name|Roll|
|-|-|-|
|1|`Common`|`🎲 1d6 +2`|
|2|`Uncommon`|`🎲 1d6 +3`|
|3|`Rare`|`🎲 2d6 +3`|
|4|`Epic`|`🎲 3d6 +3`|
|5|`Legendary`|`🎲 4d6 +5`|

## Monsters [ 🧟 ]
Upon landing on a Tile with a `🧟 Monster` Token, roll a `🎲 1dP` to determine the result, based on the table below.

In the rare event that a Tile has multiple `🧟 Monster` Tokens present, you must **aggregate** all rolls into one (cf. **"Multiply-Occupied Tiles"** for routine with example).  In that case, peform actions on the `🧟 Monsters` in the follow priority order:

1. Any `DEFECT` rolls that resulted
2. Any `BRIBE` rolls that resulted
3. Any `HARD-FIGHT`/`FIGHT` rolls that resulted

> **IMPORTANT** `🧟 Monsters` and `🤺 Mercenaries` are the *same*, and as such, any `BRIBE` or `DEFECT` treats them as identical.  The verbiage difference simply reflects where you are likely to encounter them and their general attitude toward you as the Player.

**Roll for Interaction**

|Roll|🎲[10]|🎲[20 - 70]|🎲[80 - 90]|🎲[100]|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|🎲 `1dP`|`HARD-FIGHT`|`FIGHT`|`BRIBE`|`DEFECT`|

**Roll for Monster Quantity**

|Situation|Roll|
|---|---|
|`HARD-FIGHT`|`🎲 4d6`|
|`FIGHT`|`🎲 2d6`|
|`BRIBE`|`🎲 2d6`|
|`DEFECT`|`🎲 1d6 +3`|

**Cost Implications**

|Situation|Cost `/🧟 Monster`|
|---|---|
|`BRIBE`|`3 💰`|
|`DEFECT`|`0 💰` (Free)|

#### `HARD-FIGHT`/`FIGHT`
`🎲 4d6`/`🎲 2d6` `🧟 Monsters` (depending on `🎲 1dP` roll above) `ENGAGE` the `🧙‍ Hero`, forcing it to attack.  If the `🧙‍ Hero` dies as a result, normal **Hero Death** rules apply.  If the Player wins, however, s/he is awarded the ***integer*** portion of `+💰(Monster Quantity / 2)` (i.e. **truncate** the decimal, **do not** round).

> *Example*
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |-|-|
> |`🎲 4d6`|`🎲[19]`|
> 
> **The Player will fight `🧟(x19)` and, if victorious, will receive `19 / 2 = 9.5` => `💰(+9)`**

#### `BRIBE`
Up to `🎲 2d6` `🧟 Monsters` decide to adventure with the `🧙‍ Hero`, at the expense of `💰(-3) per 🧟 Monster` to become (up to) `🤺(2d6)` for that `🧙‍ Hero`.  The Player does not have to take all of them.

#### `DEFECT`
Up to `🎲 1d6 +3` `🧟 Monsters` decide to adventure with the `🧙‍ Hero` to become `🤺(1d6 +3)` for that `🧙‍ Hero`, **for FREE**.  The Player does not have to take all of them.

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *Simplified, multiple `🧟 Monsters` on a single Tile basically treats the Tile as having a much large band of `🧟 Monsters`*
---

## Settlement [ 🏰 - `🎲 Building-Dependent` ]

> `🏰 Settlement` is the **generic** term for each Player's "city".  If the `🏰` icon precedes *other text* (e.g "`🏰 Estate`" means "`🏰 Settlement` at tier of `Estate`"), it is calling out *that* particular "Settlement Building Tier" for a specific reason--the same logic applies to `🛡️ Ramparts` (e.g. `🛡️ Pallisade`).

A Player can attack a `🏰 Settlement` in a similar capacity as fighting `🧟 Monsters` or against another `🧙‍ Hero`.

In battle, a `🏰 Settlement` gets a roll for itself.  That roll is dependent on whatever rank the `🏰 Settlement` is, *plus* additional impact if the `🏰 Settlement` has any `🛡️ Ramparts`.  To determine the final roll, add the "**Defense**" columns below.

|Tier|🏰 Settlement|Cost|Reward `/Day`|Defense|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|*Encampment*|`5 💰`|`💰(+1)`|🎲 `2d6 +6`|-|
|2|*Villa*|`10 💰`|`💰(+2)`|🎲 `3d6 +9`|`🏰 Encampment`|
|3|*Estate*|`15 💰`|`💰(+4)`|🎲 `4d6 +12`|`🏰 Villa`|
|4|*Castle*|`25 💰`|`💰(+6)`|🎲 `5d6 +15`|`🏰 Estate`|

|Tier|🛡️ Ramparts|Cost|Defense|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|*Pallisade*|`5 💰`|🎲 `1d6 +3`|`🏰 Villa`|
|2|*Fortifications*|`15 💰`|🎲 `2d6 +6`|`🛡️ Pallisade`, `🏰 Castle`|

> *Example*
> 
> An **`🏰 Estate (🎲 4d6 +12)`** with **`🛡️ Pallisade (🎲 1d6 +3)`** amounts to a total **Defense** of **`🎲 5d6 +15`**

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *You cannot purchase the next tier of `🏰 Settlement` until you have purchased its preceding tier*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *Fortifications are impossible without a `🏰 Castle`*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *To better understand dice notation and math, consult the **"Miscellaneous"** section*
---

### Garrisoned Heroes
A `Garrisoned` `🧙‍ Hero` cannot be attacked directly, as it is protected by the `🏰 Settlement`.  If a `🏰 Settlement` is attacked while a `🧙‍ Hero` is `Garrisoned`, then the `🧙‍ Hero` and its `Army` will assist in defending the `🏰 Settlement`.

> **NOTE:** If A `Garrisoned` `🧙‍ Hero` is at a `🏰 Settlement` while it is attacked, there would be a `🧙‍ Hero`, a `🏰 Settlement`, and the aggregation of the `Recruits` between the `🏰 Settlement` and the `🧙‍ Hero` (if it has any) defending the  `🏰 Settlement`.
> 
---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *While a `🧙‍ Hero` is `Garrisoned`, `🤺 Mercenaries` and `🎁 Items` can be freely exchanged between the `🏰 Settlement` and the `🧙‍ Hero`*
---

### Armory
A `🏰 Settlement's` `Armory` is simply a collection of `🎁 Items` that any `🧙‍ Hero` currently `Garrisoned` at that `🏰 Settlement` can exchange, deposit, or withdraw `🎁 Items`.

`🎁 Items` in the `Armory` do not apply to `Battle` rolls in the event of a `🏰 Settlement` assault.

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *The `Armory` is not a building that you can build, every `🏰 Settlement` comes with it*
---

### Successful Settlement Assault
If a `🏰 Settlement` falls to an assault, ***all*** `🎁 Items` in the `Armory` become the property of the conquering party.

> **IMPORTANT** If a `🏰 Settlement` has any `🎁 Items` in the `Armory` at the time of a conquest, *those items* are **not** "tokenized" like they would be in the death of a  `🧙‍ Hero`--they remain as the cards they are.

If a `🧙‍ Hero` was also *defending* a `🏰 Settlement` in the assault, ***all*** `🎁 Items` in the Armor and all `💰 Resources` at that `🏰 Settlement` now become the property of the conquering party.

All `🎁 Items` transferred from the assault go into the `🏰 Settlement's` `Armory` by default.  While it can be readily transferred to a `Garrisoned` `🧙‍ Hero`, conquered `🎁 Items` default to the `🏰 Settlement`.

## Multiply-Occupied Tiles
Any Token interaction will cost a minimum of `🐎(-1)`.  This applies to consecutive Token acquisitions on the same Tile.

> **IMPORTANT** `🎁 Items` and `💰 Resources` uniquely take `🐎(-1)` for **each** Token on a Tile, while all other Token are "automatically" interacted with simply by being on the same Tile

If a Tile is occupied by more than `1` Token, then the following priority order ***must*** be followed ***before*** a `🧙‍ Hero` can [ `INTERACT`, `ENGAGE` ] with lower-priority Tokens:

|Priority|Token(s)|Notes|
|-|-|-|
|1|`🧟 Monster`|-|
|2|`🧙‍ Hero`*|See `💡 REMINDER` below|
|3|`🏰 Settlement`|-|
|4|`🎁 Item` `💰 Resource`|Player's choice|
|5|`⚒️ Mine`|-|

In the rare event that a Tile has multiple `🧟 Monster` Tokens present, you must **aggregate** all rolls into one.  In that case, peform actions on the `🧟 Monsters` in the follow priority order:

1. Any `DEFECT` rolls that resulted
2. Any `BRIBE` rolls that resulted
3. Any `HARD-FIGHT`/`FIGHT` rolls that resulted

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *`🧙‍ Heroes` `Garrisoned` in a `🏰 Settlement` are considered a `🏰 Settlement` by priority standards, and become another unit on the `Settlement's` `Battlefield`*
---

### Example Section
Below are some various examples to help explicate the idea.

#### Example A) Multiple `🎁 Items` and `💰 Resources` Tokens on a Single Tile

> |0,0|1|2|3|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |**1**|-|-|-|
> |**2**|-|🎁🎁💰|🧙‍|
> |**3**|-|-|-|
> 
> The `🧙‍ Hero` must:
> 
> - Expend `🐎(-1)` to move from **`🗺️[3, 2]`** to **`🗺️[2, 2]`**
> - Expend `🐎(-1)` to claim the *first* `🎁 Item`
> - Expend `🐎(-1)` to claim the *second* `🎁 Item`
> - Expend `🐎(-1)` to claim the `💰 Resource`
> 
> This results in a total of `🐎(-4)` for the `🧙‍ Hero`

#### Example B) `🧟 Monster` and (`⚒️ Mine️` or `🏰 Settlement`) Tokens on a Single Tile

> If a `🧟 Monster` and a `⚒️ Mine️` occupy the same Tile, then the Player must ***first (1st)*** engage and defeat the `🧟 Monster` before the Player can interact with the `⚒️ Mine`.  The same situation would be true if the `⚒️ Mine` were instead a `🏰 Settlement`.

#### Example C) Multiple `🧟 Monster` Tokens on a Single Tile

> The `🧙‍ Hero` is about to engage `5` **aggregated** `🧟 Monster` battles--*this is an exceedingly unlikely board event to show the general idea*

## Miscellaneous
Below are some random things and situations for which Players may need additional reference and explanation.

### Dice
As a notational explicative for this section and the guide in general:

* `🎲[#]` will mean a roll ***result***
* `🎲[#] +#` will mean a roll ***result*** that must have a `B` "Bonus" added to get the total ***after all dice have been rolled***
* `🎲[#]` + `...` + `🎲[#]` will mean a roll ***result*** sequence that resulted from multiple rolls
* `🎲 NdS +B` will mean a dice roll ***to perform***
* `🎲 NdS +B` + `...` + `🎲 NdS +B` will mean a dice roll sequence ***to perform***
* `(# * 🎲 NdS) +B` + `...` + `(# * 🎲 NdS) +B` will mean a dice roll sequence ***to perform*** of **Representative Rolls**
* `(# * 🎲 NdS) +B` will mean a dice roll ***to perform***, the result of which will be multiplied by `#` and `+B` will be *added to the final result*.  This is called a **Representative Roll**

#### Bonus
Bonus is **always** added *at the very end* of ***all*** rolls.  An example roll of `🎲 2d6 +9` means:

---
> **✔️ CORRECT ✔️**
> 
> This is a *correct* method of calculation (i.e. **Individual Rolls**)
> 
> * `🎲 2d6 +9` is consistent with (`🎲 1d6` + `🎲 1d6` + `+9`)
---
> **✔️ CORRECT ✔️**
> 
> This is a *correct* method of calculation (i.e. **Representative Rolls**)
> If you remember PEMDAS from math, read `# * 🎲 NdS +B` and `(# * 🎲 NdS) +B` both as `(# * 🎲 NdS) +B`
> 
> To be representative, you would only roll `1` `🎲 d6` and *multiply* that result by `N` (in the case below, `N` is `2`).
> 
> * `🎲 2d6 +9` is consistent with (`(2 * 🎲 1d6)` + `+9`)
---
> **❌ WRONG ❌**
> 
> This is a *wrong* method of calculation and is not mathematically consistent
> 
> * `🎲 2d6 +9` is ***not*** consistent with (`🎲 1d6 +9` + `🎲 1d6 +9`)
---

#### Number-Sided-Bonus (`🎲 NdS +B`)
When writing dice rolls, the "Number-Sided-Bonus" convention is used, taking the general form of `🎲 NdS +B`.
* `N` is the "Number"
  - The *quantity* of dice
* `S` is the "Sidedness"
  - The *type* of dice
* `B` is the "Bonus"
  - After rolling all of the dice, *add* the bonus

> *Example*
> 
> A `🎲 3d6 +9` means that we will
> * **Firstly**, Roll a `6-sided` dice `3` times
>   - e.g. `🎲 3d6 +9` => `🎲[4]` + `🎲[2]` + `🎲[6]` = `🎲[12]`
> * **Lastly**, Sum the total and then *add* `+9` to it
>   - e.g. `🎲[12]` + `+9` = `21`

|Dice|Sides|Notes|
|-|-|-|
|`🎲 d4`|`4`|Increments of `1` from `🎲[1 - 4]`|
|`🎲 d6`|`6`|Increments of `1` from `🎲[1 - 6]`|
|`🎲 d10`|`10`|Increments of `1` from `🎲[1 - 10]`|
|`🎲 d12`|`12`|Increments of `1` from `🎲[1 - 12]`|
|`🎲 dP`|`10`|Increments of `10` from `🎲[10 - 00]`,  `🎲[00]` = `100%`.|

#### Dice Arithmetic

> **PSA**
> 
> Unless you understand this deeply, we recommend that you **do not** attempt to condense dice if they differ in their "Sidedness" (e.g. `🎲 1d4 +9` + `🎲 3d12 +4` + `🎲 2d6` + `🎲 1d6` + ..., etc.), but instead simply roll each dice in sequence and keep track of the running total.
> 
> In cases like the above, we recommend that you simply roll each in sequence and write down a running total and only perform condensing on `🎲 d6` dice roll sequences.  Because of this simplification, we intentionally attempted to keep the majority of dice rolls in the paradigm of `🎲 d6` for actions, and `🎲 dP` for chances.
 
That being said, if you have multiple of the *same* **Sidedness** on the combined dice roll, you can condense them into a single expression in a fairly straightforward manner.

* Firstly, simply add all the "Numbers" together as the final `N`
* Next, add all of the `B` "Bonuses" together into a final `+B`
* Lastly, consolidate into a single form: `NdS +B`, where `S` is whatever the "Sidedness" of the original dice were.

> **ASSUME:** You have `2d6 +6`, `1d6 +3`, `1d6`, `1d6`.  In this case, since we are only using `🎲 d6` dice, we can consolidate.
> 
> |Roll||Running Total of `N`|Running Total of `+B`|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |`🎲 2d6 +6`|-|`{2} = 2`|`{6} = 6`|
> |`🎲 1d6 +3`|-|`2 + {1} = 3`|`6 + {3} = 9`|
> |`🎲 1d6`|-|`2 + 1 + {1} = 4`|`6 + 3 = 9`|
> |`🎲 1d6`|-|`2 + 1 + 1 + {1} = 5`|`6 + 3 = 9`|
> 
> Take
> 
> * the final `N` of `= 5`
> * the final `B` of `= 9`
> * and the `S` of `🎲 d6` from the example's initial setup
> 
> into a consolidated form of: `🎲 5d6 +9`.

### Voting
Do not read this section too rigidly, it is meant as a high-level guidance, but the ultimate decision is up to you.

If a situation arises where a `Vote` is necessary, then each Player can "cast" `1 Vote`.  In the event of a tie (e.g. an even number of Players), choose a reconciliation method that has fair and even odds (e.g. flip a coin, roll a `1dP` and split `10 - 50` and `60 - 100`, etc.), or create a fun and/or competitive event to decide.

> **TIP:** In the event of a tie, consider introducing light-hearted fun at the other Players' expense, such as pitting each side of the `Vote` against each other by some means (e.g. a mini event, a trivia contest, etc.).

### Fractional Remains
Intuitively, imagine all fractional roles as if they were dividing people and you must keep them alive--you can't have half a person (at least, not a person that is still alive...).

Any time an event happens where there are fractional remains, you must ***always remove (truncate) the decimal portion***.  This remains true *even if* the fraction would *round* up (e.g. 0.6).

### Alliance
An `Alliance` can be made with any Player at any time, and if an `Alliance` forms, then each Player continues to operate independently; however, each Player in the `Alliance` can treat the other `Alliance Members'` `🏰 Settlements` and `Mines` and **unoccupied Tiles** for movement.

*Any other perks or restrictions are determined by the `Alliance Members` themselves.*

Alliance business is a good situation to introduce `Voting`, if the number of Players warrants it.
