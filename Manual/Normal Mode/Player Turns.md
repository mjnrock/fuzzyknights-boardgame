# Player Turns
After `Daybreak`, each Player takes his or her turn in a *counter clockwise* sequence, starting with the `Anchor`, as determined in the **Board Setup**.

## Hero [ üßô‚Äç - `üé≤ 2d6 +6` ]
In `Battle`, the `Hero` is a unit itself with a roll of `2d6 +6`.  If the `Hero` falls in `Battle` (this is called `FAINTING`), its `Army` can still fight and if successful, the `Hero` will not die.

If a `Hero` `FAINTS` in `Battle`, **all** of its `Items` are dropped on the same Tile and `50%` of its `Army` disbands.  Cut the `Army` size in half, **truncating** any decimal--*e.g. 15 / 2 = 7.5 becomes 7*.

A `Hero` must expend `üêé(-1)` for **each** `Item` to acquire it, consistent with normal `Item` acquisition rules.

## Hero Movement [ üêé ]
Each `Hero` is able to `MOVE` up to `1d10 +10` Tiles.  A `Hero` may **only** expend movement from its own movement roll, and can voluntarily end its own movement for that turn at any point.

> **ELI5**
> 
> - *A `Hero` can't "gift" another `Hero` movement*
> - *A `Hero` does not have to use all of its movement*

A `Hero` may move on any **unoccupied** Tile for `üêé(-1)`.

If the Tile is **occupied** by a Token, then the Player may: `ENGAGE` or `INTERACT` with ***each*** Token at an *additional* expense of `üêé(-1)` (i.e. a Tile could theoretically cost multiple movement, all said and done).

If the Player owns a `City` or `Mine`, then **all** of his or her `Heroes`--as well as `Allied Heroes`, if playing with `Alliances`--can treat that Tile *as if* it were unoccupied.

> **`INTERACT` NOTE:** Because of the **`üíé[4, 2]`** and **`üíé[2, 4]`**, the `Hero` must spend `üêé(-1)` on the TIle movement and `üêé(-1)` to `INTERACT` with ("pick up") the `Resource`.  Each `üêé(X)` on the `Map` below represents how movement *that Tile alone* costs.

>
> **`INTERACT` NOTE:** Notice at **`[2, 4]`** that there are `2 Item [ üéÅ ]` Tokens.  This *can only happen* as a result of a `Hero` dying on that Tile, but is perfectly acceptable under that condition for a TIle to have multiple `Item` tokens.  Because there are `üéÅ(2)`, the `Hero` must spend `üêé(-1)` to occupy the Tile, `üêé(-1)` to acquire the **first** üéÅ, and üêé(-1) to acquire the **second** üéÅ, resulting in `üêé(-1) + üêé(-1) + üêé(-1) = üêé(-3)`.
> 
> **`ENGAGE` NOTE:** A Tile occupied by a `Monster` requires the `Hero` to expend `üêé(-1)` to occupy the Tile and `üêé(-1)` to `ENGAGE` the `Monster`, resulting in `üêé(-1) + üêé(-1) = üêé(-2)`

## Hero Death
In **any and all** cases where a `Hero` dies, **all** `Items` are dropped at the Tile on which the `Hero` died.

> **[ Special Case ]** If the `Hero` dies at a `City`, the `Items` are instead placed within the `Vault` of that `City` and normal `Vault` rules apply.

If the `Hero` had any `Mercenaries` still alive within its command at the time of death (for any reason), then `1` `Monster` Token is placed on the Tile, as well.

> **NOTE:** In the case of a `Hero` death *at* a `City`, those `Monster` Tokens *are* placed on the same Tile as a `City`.  Functionally, this means that the `Monster` Token must be defeated before access to/from the `City` is possible (for any `Hero`--`Allied` or `Enemy`).  This `Monster` Token is treated like any other `Monster` Token and all normal `Monster` Token rules apply.

> **TIP:** Strategically retreating from a fight with a "Pawn Hero" can force your enemy to deal with a `Monster` Token on his or her `City`.  Be careful, though, as a Player is rewarded for killing `Monsters` and also has a `1dP` roll chance to acquire those `Monsters`.

## Mines [ ‚öíÔ∏è ]
Upon landing on a tile with a `Mine` token, the Player can attempt to `CAPTURE` the `Mine`.  Upon a successful `CAPTURE`, immediately collect **`üí∞(+1)`**.  Any time a Player attempts to change possession of a `Mine`, roll a `1dP` to determine if the `Mine` is guarded by `Guardians`.

If the `1dP` roll results in `Guardians`, the Player must roll a `1d6 +2` to determine how many `Guardians` will attempt to defend the `Mine`.  If the Player then defeats the `Guardians`, s/he `CAPTURES` the `Mine`--normal `Monster` rules apply.

**Check for Guardians**

|Roll|üé≤ 10 - 80|üé≤ 90 - 100|
|---|---|---|
|üé≤ **`1dP`**|`CAPTURE` `Mine`|`FIGHT` **`1d6 +2`** Monsters|

**Determine Guardian Quantity**

|Roll|
|---|
|üé≤ **`1d6 +2`**|

> *Example*
> 
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |üé≤ **`1dP`**|`90`|=>|`FIGHT 1d6 +2 Guardians`|
> 
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |üé≤ **`1d6 +2`**|`5`|=>|`5 Guardians`|
> 
> **Player will fight `5 Guardians`**

## Resources [ üíé ]
Upon landing on a Tile with a `Resource` Token, roll a `1dP` to determine the cache size.  The cache size will determine how much `Resource` the Player finds.

**Determine Cache Size**

|Roll|üé≤ 10 - 70|üé≤ 80 - 100|
|---|---|---|
|üé≤ **`1dP`**|Small|Large|

**Determine Cache Reward**

|Cache Size|Reward Size Roll|
|---|---|
|Small|üé≤ **`1d6 +1`**|
|Large|üé≤ **`2d6 +2`**|

> *Example*
> 
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |üé≤ **`1dP`**|`80`|=>|`Large Cache`|
> 
> |Roll|Result||Implication|
> |-|-|-|-|
> |üé≤ **`2d6 +2`**|`11`|=>|`üí∞(+11)`|
> 
> **Player receives `üí∞(+11)`**

## Items [ üéÅ ]
All Players must agree on a ruleset below, though the Players are allowed to change the ruleset at any point, if it passes a `Vote`.

### Card & Dice Rules
Upon landing on a Tile with an `Item` Token, draw a card from the `Item Deck`.  Roll the dice stated on the card to determine the `Rarity` of the `Item`.  Place a marker on the `Rarity` placeholder on the card's edge.

### Dice-Only Rules (Alternative Ruleset)
In lieu of cards, you may instead roll a `1dP` to determine the `Item Type` according to table below.  After determining `Item Type`, roll a `1dP` to determine `Rarity`.  Upon a **Success**, you may roll again; upon a **Failure** *do not* continue to roll.  **Always** start at `Common` and attempt upgrades from there--i.e. a **Failure** on the first roll results in `Common Rarity`.

If a Player rolls a **Success**, add `+1 Rarity Level` to the `Item`.  The `Item's` final stats are determined by the `Rarity` chart below:

***Main Hand***

|Rarity Level|Name|Roll|
|-|-|-|
|1|`Common`|`1d6 +2`|
|2|`Uncommon`|`1d6 +3`|
|3|`Rare`|`2d6 +3`|
|4|`Epic`|`3d6 +3`|
|5|`Legendary`|`4d6 +5`|

***Off Hand***

|Rarity Level|Name|Roll|
|-|-|-|
|1|`Common`|`1d6`|
|2|`Uncommon`|`1d6 +1`|
|3|`Rare`|`2d6`|
|4|`Epic`|`2d6 +3`|
|5|`Legendary`|`3d6 +5`|

***Amulet***

|Rarity Level|Name|Roll|
|-|-|-|
|1|`Common`|`1d6`|
|2|`Uncommon`|`1d6 +1`|
|3|`Rare`|`1d6 +2`|
|4|`Epic`|`2d6`|
|5|`Legendary`|`2d6 +3`|

**Determine Item Type**

|Roll|üé≤ 10 - 20|üé≤ 30 - 60|üé≤ 70 - 100|
|---|---|---|---|
|üé≤ **`1dP`**|`Main Hand`|`Off Hand`|`Amulet`|

**Determine Item Rarity**

|Roll|üé≤ 10 - 80|üé≤ 90 - 100|
|---|---|---|
|üé≤ **`1dP`**|**Failure**|**Success**|

## Monsters [ üßü ]
Upon landing on a Tile with a `Monster` Token, roll a `1dP` to determine the result, based on the table below.

**Roll for Interaction**

|Roll|üé≤ 10|üé≤ 20 - 70|üé≤ 80 - 90|üé≤ 100|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|üé≤ **`1dP`**|`FIGHT` **`4d6`**|`FIGHT` **`2d6`**|`BRIBE` **`2d6`**|`DEFECT` **`2d6`**|

#### `FIGHT`
`4d6`/`2d6` `Monsters` (depending on `1dP` roll above) `ENGAGE` the `Hero`, forcing it to attack.  If the `Hero` dies as a result, normal **Hero Death** rules apply.  If the Player wins, however, s/he is awarded the ***integer*** portion of `+üí∞(Monster Quantity / 2)` (i.e. **truncate** the decimal, **do not** round).

> *Example*
> 
> |Roll|Result|
> |-|-|
> |`üé≤ 4d6`|`üé≤ 19`|
> 
> **The Player will fight `üßü(x19)` and, if victorious, will receive `19 / 2 = 9.5` => `üí∞(+9)`**

#### `BRIBE`
Up to `2d6` `Monsters` decide to adventure with the `Hero`, at the expense of `üí∞(-2) per Monster`.  The Player does not have to take all of them.

> **TIP:** While the cost is 2x that of the cost at a `City`, there might be strategic advantage to boosting your `Army`--even at the higher cost--especially under circumstances where you plan to attack your enemies soon.

#### `DEFECT`
Up to `2d6` `Monsters` decide to adventure with the `Hero`, **for FREE**.  The Player does not have to take all of them.

## Cities [ üè∞ - `üé≤ 3d3 +9` ]
Before a `City` can be attacked, it must not have any `Ramparts` present.  If it does, the `Hero` must spend an entire turn (i.e. it cannot move that turn) in a Tile immediately adjacent to the `Enemy City` and `SIEGE` it.

If a `Hero` `SIEGES` a `City`, then destroy that `City's` `Ramparts`.  While a `City` is under `SIEGE`, it produces **`0 Resources`** and it cannot produce `Mercenaries`, `Heroes`, or `Buildings` during the next `Daybreak`.

Once the `Ramparts` are destroyed, a `Hero` can attack the `City` as it would attack a `Monster` Token.  In `Battle`, the `City` get its own roll of `3d3 +9` each round.

## Multiply-Occupied Tiles
If a Tile is occupied by more than `1` Token, then the following priority order ***must*** be followed ***before*** a `Hero` can [ `INTERACT`, `ENGAGE` ] with lower-priority Tokens:

|Priority|Token(s)|Notes|
|-|-|-|
|1|`üßü Monster`|-|
|2|`üßô‚Äç Hero`|-|
|3|`üè∞ City`|-|
|4|`üéÅ Item` `üíé Resource`|Player choice|
|5|`‚öíÔ∏è Mine`|-|

> *Example*
> 
> If a `Monster` and an `MineÔ∏è` occupy the same Tile, then the Player must ***first*** `ENGAGE` and defeat the `Monster` before the Player can `INTERACT` with the `Mine`--this results in `üêé(-2)`.

## Voting
If a situation arises where a `Vote` is necessary, then each Player can "cast" `1 Vote`.  In the event of a tie (e.g. an even number of Players), the `Anchor` determines the result based on whatever criteria s/he chooses.  If this becomes problematic, the `Vote` automatically fails.

> **TIP:** In the event of a tie and you are the `Anchor`, consider introducing light-hearted fun at the other Players' expense, such as pitting each side of the `Vote` against each other by some means (e.g. a mini event, a trivia contest, etc.).
