# Daybreak
At the beginning of every `Day`, **all** Players engage in `💰 Resource` collection and expenditures.  Players can `Build` **one (1)** time per `Day`, per `🏰 City`.  Any `🤺 Mercenaries` purchased will be placed at the `🏰 City` and a `🧙‍ Hero` must come and collect them.

> If a `🧙‍ Hero` is already `Garrisoned` to a `🏰 City` and `🤺 Mercenaries` are purchased (at that same `🏰 City`), then the Player can decide how to allocate those `🤺 Mercenaries` between that `🏰 City` and that `🧙‍ Hero`.

## Step 1) Distribute Resources [ 💰 ]
`🏰 Cities` and `Mines` generate `💰 Resources` each `Day`.  How much they each generate is described below.

### Step 1.A) City [ 🏰 ]
*Each* `🏰 City` awards its Player-owner the `💰 Resources` below

|💰|
|---|
|**`+2`**|

> *Example* **3 Cities**
> 
> **`💰(+2) * 🏰(3)`** = **`💰(+6)`**

### Step 1.B) Mines [ ⚒️ ]
*Each* `Mine` awards its Player-owner the `💰 Resources` below

|💰|
|---|
|**`+1`**|

> *Example* **5 Mines**
> 
> **`💰(+1) * ⚒️(5)`** = **`💰(+5)`**

## Step 2) Paying Heroes [ 🧙‍ ]
Each `🧙‍ Hero` that a Player has must be paid *each* turn to continue to fight for the Player.  If the Player cannot afford to pay any or all of the `🧙‍ Heroes`, s/he must kill each `🧙‍ Hero` that s/he cannot afford.  All normal `🧙‍ Hero` `DEATH` rules apply.

|💰|
|---|
|**`-1`**|

> *Example* **2 Heroes**
> 
> **`💰(-1) * 🧙‍(2)`** = **`💰(-2)`**

## Step 3) Building and Recruitment
Each `🏰 City` can build **one (1)** `Building` per `Day`.  Players can `Recruit` as many `🤺 Mercenaries` as s/he can afford, so long as all prerequisites are met.

### Step 3.A) Buildings
|Gold Mine|Cost|Reward `/Day`|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|*Level 1*|**`3 💰`**|**`💰(+1)`**|*City*|
|*Level 2*|**`5 💰`**|**`💰(+1)`**|*Level 1*|
|*Level 3*|**`8 💰`**|**`💰(+2)`**|*Level 2*|
|*Level 4*|**`13 💰`**|**`💰(+3)`**|*Level 3*|
|*Level 5*|**`21 💰`**|**`💰(+5)`**|*Level 4*|

|Ramparts|Cost|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|
|*Level 1*|**`5 💰`**|*City*|

|Mercenary Camp|Cost|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|
|*Level 1*|**`5 💰`**|*City*|

### Step 3.B) Recruitment [ 🧙‍, 🤺 ]
|Hero|Cost|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|
|*🧙‍ Hero*|**`5 💰`**|*City*|

|Recruit|Cost|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|
|*🤺 Mercenary*|**`1 💰`**|*Mercenary Camp*|

## Step 4) Token Placement Rolls
*Starting on the second* `Day`, **all** Players roll a `1dP >= 60`.  In the event of a successful roll, that Player should then roll a `1d4` to determine which type of Token s/he will place.  After determining the Token type, the Player can place that Token on **any** unoccupied Tile.

> **TIP:** Strategically consider placing Monsters on the board to restrict Players from certain paths while that Monster remains, or to place `🎁 Items` and `💰 Resources` in defensible or allied territory

**Roll for Success**

|Roll|🎲 10 - 50|🎲 60 - 100|
|---|---|---|
|🎲 **`1dP`**|-|Roll `1d4` to determine Token type|

**Roll for Token Type**

|Roll|🎲 1 - 2|🎲 3|🎲 4|
|---|---|---|---|
|🎲 **`1d4`**|`💰 Resource`|`🎁 Item`|`🧟 Monster`|

## Step 5) Player Turns
Starting with the `Anchor` and moving through Players in a *counter clockwise* manner, each Player takes individual turns moving `🧙‍ Heroes`, performing `BATTLE`, and interacting with Tokens on the `Map`.

Once **all** Players have taken their turns, start a new `Day` and begin the `Daybreak` routine.
