# Daybreak [ ☀️ ]
At the beginning of every turn cycle, `☀️ Daybreak` occurs.  **All** Players engage in `💰 Resource` collection and expenditures.  Players can build **`1`** `Building` per `☀️ Day`.  Any `🤺 Mercenaries` purchased will be placed at the `🏰 Settlement` and a `🧙‍ Hero` must come and collect them.

> If a `🧙‍ Hero` is already `Garrisoned` to a `🏰 Settlement` and `🤺 Mercenaries` are purchased (at that same `🏰 Settlement`), then the Player can decide how to allocate those `🤺 Mercenaries` between that `🏰 Settlement` and that `🧙‍ Hero`.

## Step 1) Distribute Resources [ 💰 ]
`🏰 Settlement` and owned `Mines` generate `💰 Resources` each `☀️ Day`.  How much they each generate is described below.

### Step 1.A) Settlement [ 🏰 ]
*Each* `🏰 Settlement` awards its Player the `💰 Resources` below

|Capital Upgrades|Reward `/Day`|Notes|
|-|-|-|
|*Encampment*|`💰(+1)`|*Starting tier of a `🏰 Settlement`*|
|*Villa*|`💰(+2)`|
|*Estate*|`💰(+4)`|
|*Castle*|`💰(+6)`|

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *`🏰 Settlements` start out at Encampment and additional upgrades must be purchased*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *You **cannot** build another `🏰 Settlement`, so be careful with it!*
---

### Step 1.B) Mines [ ⚒️ ]
*Each* `Mine` awards its Player the `💰 Resources` below

|💰|
|---|
|**`+1`**|

> *Example* **5 Mines**
> 
> **`💰(+1) * ⚒️(5)`** = **`💰(+5)`**

## Step 2) Paying Heroes [ 🧙‍ ]
Each `🧙‍ Hero` that a Player has must be paid *each* turn to continue to fight for the Player.  If the Player cannot afford to pay any or all of the `🧙‍ Heroes`, s/he must kill each `🧙‍ Hero` that s/he cannot afford.  All normal `🧙‍ Hero` `DEATH` rules apply.

|💰|
|---|
|**`-1`**|

> *Example* **2 Heroes**
> 
> **`💰(-1) * 🧙‍(2)`** = **`💰(-2)`**

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *You can only have up to `2 🧙‍ Heroes` at a time*
---

## Step 3) Building and Recruitment
`🏰 Settlements` can build **`1`** `Building` per `☀️ Day`.

Each Player can `Recruit` as many `🤺 Mercenaries` as s/he can afford at a `🏰 Settlement`.

### Step 3.A) Buildings

|🏰 Settlement|Cost|Reward `/Day`|Defense|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|*Encampment*|**`5 💰`**|**`💰(+1)`**|🎲 `2d6 +6`|-|
|*Villa*|**`10 💰`**|**`💰(+2)`**|🎲 `3d6 +9`|*Encampment*|
|*Estate*|**`15 💰`**|**`💰(+4)`**|🎲 `4d6 +12`|*Villa*|
|*Castle*|**`25 💰`**|**`💰(+6)`**|🎲 `5d6 +15`|*Estate*|

|🛡️ Ramparts|Cost|Defense|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|-|
|*Pallisade*|**`5 💰`**|🎲 `1d6 +3`|`🏰 Settlement`, *Villa*|
|*Fortifications*|**`15 💰`**|🎲 `2d6 +6`|*Pallisade*, *Castle*|

### Step 3.B) Recruitment [ 🧙‍, 🤺 ]


|🧙‍ Hero|Cost|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|
|*Hero*|**`5 💰`**|`🏰 Settlement`|

|🤺 Mercenary|Cost|Prerequisite|
|-|-|-|
|*Mercenary*|**`2 💰`**|*Mercenary Camp*|

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *You cannot build an `Armory`--it comes by default*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *All recruitment takes place at the `🏰 Settlement` and all recruits spawn there*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *`🤺 Mercenaries` cannot move on their own, so a `🧙‍ Hero` must be there to pick them up*
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *The `🏰 Settlement` and the `🛡️ Ramparts` are themselves units on the battlefield when a `🏰 Settlement` is under attack*
---

## Step 4) Token Placement Rolls
**All** Players roll a `🎲 1dP` to attempt to place a Token on the `🗺️ Map`.

Each Player that rolls **successfully** should then roll a `🎲 1d4` to determine which type of Token s/he will place.  After determining the Token type, the Player can place that Token on **any** unoccupied Tile.

> **TIP:** Strategically consider placing Monsters on the board to restrict Players from certain paths while that Monster remains, or to place `🎁 Items` and `💰 Resources` in defensible or allied territory

**Roll for Success**

|Roll|🎲[10 - 50]|🎲[60 - 100]|
|---|---|---|
|🎲 `1dP`|-|Roll `1d4` to determine Token type|

**Roll for Token Type**

|Roll|🎲[1 - 2]|🎲[3]|🎲[4]|
|---|---|---|---|
|🎲 `1d4`|`💰 Resource`|`🎁 Item`|`🧟 Monster`|

## Step 5) Player Turns
Starting with the `⚓ Anchor` and moving through Players in a *counter clockwise* manner, each Player takes individual turns moving `🧙‍ Heroes`, performing battle, and interacting with Tokens on the `🗺️ Map`.

Once **all** Players have taken their turns, start a new `☀️ Day` and begin the `☀️ Daybreak` routine.
