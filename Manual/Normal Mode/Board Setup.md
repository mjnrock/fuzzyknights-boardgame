# Board Setup

*[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)*

There can be up to **`4`** Players per Game Board (`🗺️ Map`).  If multiple `🗺️ Maps` are being used, Players can choose how to align them.

> **TIP:** *Choosing different ways to align multiple `🗺️ Maps` will change how the strategy of the game will play out (e.g. 4 `🗺️ Maps` in a line configuration, versus 4 `🗺️ Maps` in a square configuration, etc.)*

## Step 1) Banker

*[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)*

Choose a banker(s) by whatever method you wish (e.g. a designated banker, self-banking, etc.)

## Step 2) Token Placement

*[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)*

There are **`4`** different types of tokens that will be dropped or placed randomly (Players' choice) on the board for setup.

|Token|Symbol|Quantity|
|---|---|---|
|Item|🎁|3 x Player Count|
|Resource|💰|4 x Player Count|
|Monster|🧟|4 x Player Count|
|Mine|⚒️|3 x Player Count|

> *Example*
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> 
> |Token|Symbol|Quantity|
> |---|---|---|
> |Item|🎁|9|
> |Resource|💰|12|
> |Monster|🧟|12|
> |Mine|⚒️|9|

## Step 3) Determine the `⚓ Anchor`

*[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)*

Each Player will roll `🎲 1d6`. The highest roll becomes the `⚓ Anchor` and Player turn-order will proceed *counter clockwise* from the `⚓ Anchor`.

In the event of ties on the highest rolls, those Players continue to roll `🎲 1d6` until the tie is resolved.

|Roll|
|---|
|`🎲 1d6`|

> *Example*
> **Comparing Rolls**
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> 
> |Player|Roll|Result|
> |---|---|---|
> |Player A|`🎲 1d6`|`🎲[6]`|
> |Player B|`🎲 1d6`|`🎲[2]`|
> |Player C|`🎲 1d6`|`🎲[3]`|
> 
> As a result, **Player A** goes first.  Play would proceed *counter clockwise* to **Player A**

---
- **`💡 REMINDER`** *The `⚓ Anchor` simply determines who goes first whenever Player ordering must take place (e.g. placing `🏰 Settlements`, moving `🧙‍ Heroes`, etc.)*

---

## Step 4) Settlement Placement

*[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)*

Once the `⚓ Anchor` has been determined, the `🏰 Settlement` of each Player will be placed on **any** open tile on the map.

The `⚓ Anchor` will place his or her `🏰 Settlement` first, then each Player *counter clockwise* will take turns placing his or her `🏰 Settlement` until all `🏰 Settlements` have been placed.

> *Example*
> 
> **2 Players worth of Tokens**
> 
> |0,0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
> |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
> |**1**|💰|-|-|🏰|-|-|💰|-|-|🎁|
> |**2**|-|-|⚒️|-|🎁|-|-|🧟|⚒️|-|
> |**3**|🧟|-|💰|-|-|-|-|💰|-|-|
> |**4**|-|💰|-|-|-|💰|🧟|-|-|-|
> |**5**|-|-|🧟|-|-|-|-|⚒️|🎁|-|
> |**6**|🎁|-|-|💰|🏰|-|🧟|-|-|-|
> |**7**|-|-|-|⚒️|-|🎁|-|-|⚒️|-|
> |**8**|-|🧟|-|-|-|🧟|-|🎁|-|-|
> |**9**|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
> |**10**|⚒️|-|-|-|💰|-|-|🧟|-|-|
> 
> *Results*
> 
> **`Player 1: CONSTRUCT 🏰 at (4, 1)`**
> 
> **`Player 2: CONSTRUCT 🏰 at (5, 6)`**

## Step 5) Distribute Resources

*[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)*

There is **`1`** type of `Resource` called **Coin [ 💰 ]**.

|Resource|Symbol|
|---|---|
|Coin|💰|

Each Player receives an **initial cache** of resources, as specified below.

|💰|
|---|
|**`+5`**|
