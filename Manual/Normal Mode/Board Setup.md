# Board Setup
There can be up to **four (4)** Players per Game Board (`Map`).  If multiple `Maps` are being used, Players can choose how to align them.

> *Choosing different ways to align multiple `Maps` will change how the strategy of the game will play out (e.g. 4 `Maps` in a line configuration, versus 4 `Maps` in a square configuration, etc.)*

## Banker
Choose a banker(s) by whatever method you wish (e.g. a designated banker, self-banking, etc.)

## Token Placement
There are **four (4)** different types of tokens that will be dropped or placed randomly (Players' choice) on the board for setup.

|Token|Symbol|Quantity|
|---|---|---|
|Item|🎁|3 x Player Count|
|Resource|💎|4 x Player Count|
|Monster|🧟|4 x Player Count|
|Mine|⚒️|3 x Player Count|

> *Example*
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> 
> |Token|Symbol|Quantity|
> |---|---|---|
> |Item|🎁|9|
> |Resource|💎|12|
> |Monster|🧟|12|
> |Mine|⚒️|9|

## Determine First Player
Every Player will roll **`1d6`**. The highest roll goes first and Player turn-order will proceed *counter clockwise* from the **First Player**.
In the event of ties on the highest rolls, those Players continue to roll **`1d6`** until the tie is resolved.

|Roll|
|---|
|🎲 **`1d6`**|

> *Example*
> **Comparing Rolls**
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> 
> |Player|Roll|Result|
> |---|---|---|
> |Player A|**`1d6`**|🎲 **6**|
> |Player B|**`1d6`**|🎲 **2**|
> |Player C|**`1d6`**|🎲 **3**|
> 
> As a result, **Player A** goes first.  Play would proceed *counter clockwise* to **Player A**

## City Placement
Once the **First Player** has been determined, the `City` of each Player will be placed on **any** open tile on the map.  The **First Player** will place his or her `City` first, the each Player *counter clockwise* will take turns placing his or her city until all `Cities` have been placed.

> *Example*
> 
> **2 Players worth of Tokens**
