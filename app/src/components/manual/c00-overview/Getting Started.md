# Getting Started
## Distribute Resources
There are **four (4)** different types of resources

|Resource|Symbol|
|-|-|
|Coin|💰|
|Wood|🌳|
|Food|🥩|
|Stone|⛏️|

Each Player receives an **initial cache** of resources, as specified below.
|💰|🌳|
|-|-|
|**`+5`**|**`+10`**|

## Determine First Player
Every Player will roll **`1d6`**. The highest roll goes first and Player turn-order will proceed *counter clockwise* from the "First Player".
In the event of ties on the highest rolls, those Players continue to roll **`1d6`** until the tie is resolved.

> *Example*
> **Comparing Rolls**
> 
> **Total Players: 3**
> |Player|Roll|Result|
> |-|-|-|
> |Player A|**`1d6`**|🎲 **6**|
> |Player B|**`1d6`**|🎲 **2**|
> |Player C|**`1d6`**|🎲 **3**|
> As a result, **Player A** goes first.  Play would proceed *counter clockwise* to **Player A**

## Play Phases
Turns are broken down into **two (2)** types: 1) Days and 2) Player turns. Before **all** Player turns, a new Day arises resulting in resource gains and the ability to strengthen fortifications and military size.

Once all Players have gone through the phases below:
1. **Resource Phase**
2. **Remittance Phase**
3. **Build & Recruitment Phase**

then the "Day Portion" is over and Exploration Phases begin for the Players, starting with the "First Player" and moving *counter clockwise* through the Players.

### Days

Each Player receives the cache below for each City that s/he owns.

### Player Turns
#### Exploration Phase
##### Movement [ 🐎 ]
To begin exploring, roll **`1d10`** to determine movement range for **each Hero**.  Each result number amounts to one tile of movement.  The Player can **`MOVE`** his or her Heroes (up to each individual roll limit for the turn) in any interval, in any rotation or order, until all movement is either exhausted or all Heroes have chosen to **`STAY`**.

> *Example*
> **Rolling for Movement**
> 
> **Total Heroes: 3**
> |Hero|Roll|Result|
> |-|-|-|
> |Hero A|**`1d10`**|🎲 **4**|
> |Hero B|**`1d10`**|🎲 **9**|
> |Hero C|**`1d10`**|🎲 **1**|
> 
> *Result*
> 
> **`Hero A: 🐎(+4) this turn`**
> 
> **`Hero B: 🐎(+9) this turn`**
> 
> **`Hero C: 🐎(+1) this turn`**

> 
> *Example*
> **Movement Sequence**
> 
> |Sequence|Action|🐎 A|🐎 B|🐎 C|
> |-|-|-|-|-|
> |**Hero A**|**`MOVE 🐎(-1)`**|`4 - 1 = 3`|`9`|`1`|
> |**Hero C**|**`STAY 🐎`**|`3`|`9`|`STAY => 0`|
> |**Hero B**|**`MOVE 🐎(-7)`**|`3`|`9 - 7 = 2`|`0`|
> |**Hero A**|**`MOVE 🐎(-3)`**|`3 - 3 = 0`|`2`|`0`|
> |**Hero B**|**`MOVE 🐎(-2)`**|`0`|`2 - 2 = 0`|`0`|
