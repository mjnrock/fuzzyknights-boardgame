# Getting Started
## Distribute Resources
Each player receives an initial cache of resources, as specified below.
|💰|🌳|
|-|-|
|**`+5`**|**`+10`**|

## Determine First Player
Every Player will roll **`1d6`**. The highest roll goes first and Player turn-order will proceed *counter clockwise* from the "First Player".
In the event of ties on the highest rolls, those Players continue to roll **`1d6`** until the tie is resolved.

## Play Phases
Turns are broken down into **two (2)** types: 1) Days and 2) Player turns. Before **all** Player turns, a new Day arises resulting in resource gains and the ability to strengthen fortifications and military size.

Once all Players have gone through the phases below:
1. **Resource Phase**
2. **Remittance Phase**
3. **Build & Recruitment Phase**

then the "Day Portion" is over and Exploration Phases begin for the Players, starting with the "First Player" and moving *counter clockwise* through the Players.
